Project Description

The proposed project aims to enhance the management system of The Place GianGaela's Catering Services and Restaurants, located in Batangas City, in alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The project focuses on achieving SDG 8, which emphasizes full and productive employment, sustainable economic growth, and decent work opportunities.

To address challenges related to manual appointment and reservation processes, the project will implement an automated system by creating an application. This system will streamline operations, improve communication with clients, and reduce errors, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.

The "G&G App" is a mobile application that makes use of ionic7, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. By automating appointment and reservation procedures, the project aims to increase production efficiency and potentially reduce the need for manual labor. This will contribute to long-term economic growth while creating more employment opportunities within the business.

The system's real-time availability feature will attract more clients by providing up-to-date information on booking availability. This will promote sustainable economic growth through increased business volume, repeat customers, and heightened customer satisfaction.
